                        <p>
                            The leopard (Panthera pardus) is one of the five species in the genus Panthera, a member of the Felidae.[3] 
                            The leopard occurs in a wide range in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia and is listed as Vulnerable on the 
                            IUCN Red List because leopard populations are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, and are declining in 
                            large parts of the global range.(wikipedia)

                    <li class='typeCat1'><b>Lions</b></li>
                        <p>
                            The lion (Panthera leo) is a species in the cat family (Felidae); it is a muscular, deep-chested cat with a short, 
                            rounded head, a reduced neck and round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. The lion is sexually dimorphic; 
                            males are larger than females with a typical weight range of 150 to 250 kg (331 to 551 lb) for the former and 120 to 182 kg (265 to 401 lb) 
                            for the latter. Male lions have a prominent mane, which is the most recognisable feature of the species.(wikipedia)

                        <p>
                            The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest cat species, most recognizable for its pattern of dark vertical stripes on reddish-orange fur with a 
                            lighter underside. The species is classified in the genus Panthera with the lion, leopard, jaguar, and snow leopard. It is an apex predator, primarily
                            preying on ungulates such as deer and bovids. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, often requiring large contiguous areas of
                            habitat that support its prey requirements.(wikipedia)

                            <li class='smallType'><b>Tabby</b></li>
                    <p>
                        A tabby is any domestic cat (Felis catus) that has a coat featuring distinctive stripes, dots, lines or swirling patterns, usually together with a mark resembling 
                        an 'M' on its forehead. Tabbies are sometimes erroneously assumed to be a cat breed.[1] In fact, the tabby pattern is found in many breeds, and is a genetic landrace 
                        common among the general mixed-breed population. The tabby pattern is a naturally occurring feature that may be related to the coloration of the domestic cat's direct ancestor, 
                        the African wildcat (Felis lybica lybica), which—along with the European wildcat (Felis silvestris silvestris) and Asiatic wildcat (Felis lybica ornata)—has a similar coloration. 
                        A genetic study found five genetic clusters from tabbies to be ancestral to wildcats of various parts of the world.[2](wikipedia)

                <li class='smallType1'><b>Siamese</b></li>
                    <p>
                        The Siamese cat is one of the first distinctly recognized breeds of Asian cat. Derived from the Wichianmat landrace, one of several varieties of cat native to Thailand (formerly known as Siam), 
                        the Siamese became one of the most popular breeds in Europe and North America in the 19th century. The carefully refined modern Siamese is characterized by blue almond-shaped eyes; a triangular
                        head shape; large ears; an elongated, slender, and muscular body; and point colouration. (Aside from the colouration, it bears little resemblance to the original stock, and the more moderate, traditional 
                        or "old-style" Siamese, with a much rounder head and body, has been re-established by multiple registries as the Thai cat.)(wikipedia)

                <li class='smallType'><b>Baby Bobcat</b></li>
                    <p>
                        The bobcat (Lynx rufus)[2][3] is a North American cat that appeared during the Irvingtonian stage of around 1.8 million years ago (AEO).[4] Containing 2 recognized subspecies, it ranges from southern 
                        Canada to central Mexico, including most of the contiguous United States. The bobcat is an adaptable predator that inhabits wooded areas, as well as semidesert, urban edge, forest edge, and swampland environments. 
                        It remains in some of its original range, but populations are vulnerable to local extinction ("extirpation") by coyotes and domestic animals. With a gray to brown coat, whiskered face, and black-tufted ears, the bobcat 
                        resembles the other species of the midsized genus Lynx. (wikipedia)
